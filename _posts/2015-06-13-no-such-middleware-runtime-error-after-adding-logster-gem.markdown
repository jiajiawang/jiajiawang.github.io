[Logster](https://github.com/discourse/logster) is a web log viewer for Rack
applications.
By using it you can view your app logs easily in browser.

Today, I try to set it up for a rails api app so that the mobile app developers
can easily see things like if their request has been successfully received by
the server or not.

The [installation of Logster](https://github.com/discourse/logster#installation) is fairly simple.
And this is not the first time I have done it.
However unexpected things happened.

When I restarted the rails server after installing it, I got error
`actionpack-4.1.10/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/stack.rb:125:in 'assert_index': No such middleware to insert after: ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions (RuntimeError)`.

Then to see what's going wrong with the middlewares, I tried to run `rake
middleware`.
But it failed with the same error.
So I removed Logster and then `rake middleware` showed me the list of all
middlewares the app was using. And `ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` was in the
list.

My first thought was that Logster tried to insert its middleware after
`ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions`. But for some reason it couldn't find it.

I had no clue what's going wrong. So I created an new rails app and installed
Logster to see if it works or not. Unsurprisingly the rails server started
successfully and it worked well.

It's the google time then. However I couldn't find anything helpful.

Suddenly when I ran `rake middleware` in the new test app, I noticed
that `ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` wasn't in the list any more.
Instead, `Logster::Middleware::DebugExceptions` appeared at the place where
`ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` was supposed to be.

!!! The problem wasn't Logster, but a gem after Logster.

So I went back to see the real app's middleware list. The one next to
`ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` was `BetterErrors::Middleware`.
And in the Gemfile, `gem 'better_errors'` was behind `gem 'logster'`.

Finally, moving `better_errors` ahead of `logster` solved the problem.
